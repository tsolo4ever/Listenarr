## [0.2.57] - 2026-03-08

### Added
- **Library payload and status regression coverage:** Added focused backend and frontend regression tests covering slim `/library` payload behavior, wanted-flag correctness, shared audiobook status calculation, and download-client host normalization across NZBGet, qBittorrent, SABnzbd, and Transmission.

### Changed
- **Slimmed `/library` list contract:** Converted `GET /library` from a hybrid list/detail response into a lighter list payload, while keeping `GET /library/{id}` as the rich single-audiobook detail endpoint.
- **Server-side library status evaluation:** Moved list status calculation into shared backend/frontend helpers so library and collection views no longer depend on full file metadata from the list response to derive status.
- **Event-driven library badge updates:** Removed periodic full-library polling for the Wanted badge in favor of store-driven updates backed by existing SignalR events, keeping a reconnect refresh path instead of a timer.
- **Deduplicated library fetches and client-side lookups:** Updated the frontend library store and app shell to collapse concurrent `/library` requests into a single in-flight fetch and reuse cached library state for header search and related UI lookups.
- **Download client URI handling normalization:** Standardized host/scheme/port/path handling across all download clients through a shared URI builder so adapters and monitor paths all interpret download-client connection settings consistently.

### Fixed
- **Slow `/library` responses on large or remote libraries:** Removed per-audiobook filesystem existence checks from the library list path and replaced them with DB-backed wanted-state evaluation, eliminating expensive synchronous disk/network probes during list loads.
- **Duplicate `/library` requests during app startup:** Fixed overlapping library fetches from the app shell and library views so initial navigation no longer issues redundant full-library requests.
- **Library polling churn:** Stopped the app from re-fetching the full library every 60 seconds just to refresh the Wanted badge.
- **NZBGet host parsing failures (`http:80` / name resolution errors):** Fixed malformed URL construction when users paste a scheme or path into download-client host fields, and applied the same normalization to qBittorrent, SABnzbd, and Transmission to prevent the same bug class across clients.
- **Extra database work in audiobook detail loading:** Collapsed the audiobook detail route from a two-query existence-check/fetch pattern into a single no-tracking detail query.

## [0.2.56] - 2026-03-05

### Added
- **Swagger endpoint documentation:** Added comprehensive XML doc comments (`<summary>`, `<param>`, `<remarks>`, `<response>`) to all ~133 API endpoints across 22 controllers for improved Swagger UI discoverability and developer experience.
- **Swagger tag grouping and ordering:** Added `[Tags("...")]` attributes to all controllers with a custom `SwaggerTagOrderDocumentFilter` providing logical tag ordering and descriptions in the Swagger UI.
- **Custom Transmission RPC path support:** Added frontend and backend support for configuring a non-default Transmission RPC endpoint path (`urlBase`), allowing connections to installations that use custom paths instead of `/transmission/rpc`.
- **Frontend regression coverage (Prowlarr import):** Added a unit test for the Settings → Indexers "Import from Prowlarr" modal validating that entering host in URL/IP and port in the dedicated Port field submits the expected API payload.
- **Import lifecycle regression coverage:** Added focused `CompletedDownloadProcessor` unit tests covering:
  - non-blocking retry behavior on first import failure (`ImportPending`, attempts incremented, no manual-interaction toast),
  - threshold blocking behavior on third failure attempt (`ImportBlocked`, reason/messages persisted, manual-interaction toast + history event),
  - blocked/manual-interaction flow for no-importable-files post-import guard.
- **Reconciliation and adapter conformance coverage:** Added focused regression tests for queue rebind precedence, missing-queue retention, import-candidate eligibility, and adapter filtering behavior (Transmission, qBittorrent, SABnzbd, NZBGet).
- **Import-path resolution coverage:** Added regression tests for single-file and multi-file import path resolution across Transmission, qBittorrent, SABnzbd, and NZBGet.
- **Manual-interaction workflow coverage:** Added regression tests and API support for blocked-import signaling, block-reason visibility on single-download responses, and retry/unblock transition (`ImportBlocked -> ImportPending`) via `POST /api/v{version}/downloads/{id}/retry-import`.
- **Recovery coverage:** Added regression tests for startup stuck-job reset behavior, duplicate requeue prevention during restart windows, and import-attempt counter persistence across processor restarts.
- **API/UI status mapping coverage:** Added regression tests to lock status-surface consistency (`ImportPending` included in active/downloading mappings, `ImportBlocked` treated as failed/terminal) across backend downloads endpoints and frontend Activity/Wanted status buckets.
- **Shared `TorrentFileDownloader` service:** Extracted reusable service for pre-downloading torrent files and resolving magnet URI redirects, used by Transmission and qBittorrent adapters.
- **Windows path length enforcement:** Added backend `EnsurePathWithinLimits()` method in `FileNamingService` and frontend `usePathLengthCheck` composable providing real-time path length warnings in FileManagementSection, AddLibraryModal, EditAudiobookModal, and MoveAudiobookModal.

### Changed
- **API route casing normalization:** Replaced implicit `[controller]` route tokens with explicit lowercase route strings across all controllers for consistent URL casing.
- **Prowlarr compatibility endpoints hidden from Swagger:** Added `[ApiExplorerSettings(IgnoreApi = true)]` to `ProwlarrCompatController` to hide internal compatibility endpoints from the public API documentation while keeping them functional.
- **Explicit import lifecycle state handling:** Strengthened Sonarr-parity lifecycle behavior around `Completed -> ImportPending -> Moved/ImportBlocked` by formalizing retry-vs-block transition semantics and ensuring failure metadata (`ImportAttempts`, block reason/messages) is consistently persisted.
- **Active/in-progress parity semantics:** Treated `ImportPending` as an in-progress state across queue/monitoring and status-derived views while preserving `ImportBlocked` as terminal/manual-interaction-required.
- **qBittorrent item-surface parity:** Applied configured qBittorrent category filtering parameter to `GetItemsAsync` so queue and item surfaces use the same category constraint.
- **Download-client category filtering parity:** Normalized qBittorrent category filtering to trim configured category values and aligned monitor fallback queries with the shared category filter behavior used by Transmission, SABnzbd, and NZBGet.
- **Expanded audio file format support:** Added `.wv` (WavPack), `.wma`, `.ape` (Monkey's Audio), `.alac`, `.aif`, and `.aiff` to the recognized audio extensions in `FileUtils.AudioExtensions`, enabling import of audiobooks in lossless/less-common formats.

### Fixed
- **Debug test/build contamination from stale output trees:** Excluded `bin/**` and `artifacts/**` from default SDK compile items in the API and API test projects so Debug builds no longer compile stale generated sources from prior runs.
- **Disabled download clients still contacted by background services:** Fixed multiple code paths where disabled download clients were still being contacted for import resolution, post-import cleanup, and deferred removals — causing persistent log spam and unnecessary network calls. Added `IsEnabled` guards in:
  - `ImportItemResolutionService.ResolveImportItemAsync` — skips adapter calls for disabled clients
  - `DownloadProcessingBackgroundService.EnqueueCompletedDownloadsAsync` — filters completed downloads by enabled client IDs before processing
  - `DownloadMonitorService.FinalizeDownloadAsync` — re-checks client enabled status before finalization (handles mid-cycle disabling and scheduled retries)
  - `CompletedDownloadProcessor.ProcessCompletedDownloadAsync` — skips `MarkItemAsImportedAsync` and `RemoveAsync` cleanup for disabled clients
  - `CompletedDownloadHandlingService.ProcessDeferredRemovalsAsync` — skips deferred removal calls for disabled clients
  - `DownloadService.RemoveFromQueueAsync` — skips client removal calls when target client is disabled (both explicit and record-fallback paths)
  - `DownloadHashRetrievalService.TryRetrieveHashAsync` — defensive guard against future callers
- **Webhook notifications silently stopped dispatching:** Restored notification delivery by registering `INotificationService` in DI and having `NotificationService` implement the interface used by completed-download and move flows.
- **Completed-download actions not persisting in settings UI:** Fixed `RemoveCompletedDownloads` save/reload flow by returning the top-level property from API responses, hydrating the Vue form from the top-level field, and fetching antiforgery tokens using the current authenticated principal.
- **Deferred client cleanup skipped when nothing was import-ready:** Fixed `CompletedDownloadHandlingService` so deferred removals still run even when there are no `Completed` or `ImportPending` items in the same cycle.
- **Transmission/qBittorrent completed-item cleanup deferred forever without seed limits:** Fixed both torrent clients so "remove from client" does not wait forever when no effective seed ratio or idle seeding limits are configured; qBittorrent also now separates `CanBeRemoved` from stricter file-move gating.
- **Prowlarr import URL/port handling:** Prowlarr import now reliably supports both input styles: `hostOrIp:port` directly in URL/IP field, or host/IP in URL/IP field with port in the dedicated Port field.
- **Port input normalization and validation:** Hardened frontend/backend handling for port values by enforcing valid integer TCP port range checks (1–65535).
- **Manual interaction signaling reliability:** Ensured blocked-import paths consistently emit manual-interaction UX signals (warning toast + `ImportBlocked` history entry) and record import-failure history details for auditability.
- **Transmission 301 redirect handling:** Pre-download torrent files before sending to Transmission to handle 301 redirects and magnet URI resolution that Transmission cannot follow natively.
- **Duplicate Activity entries:** Fixed matching logic in `DownloadService` and `DownloadQueueService` to check `ClientDownloadId` metadata first, preventing duplicate download records when queue items were re-matched by title alone.
- **FileMover hardlink cross-drive warning:** Improved logging when hardlink creation fails due to cross-drive source/destination, clearly indicating the fallback to copy.
- **Runtime display showing incorrect hours:** Fixed `formatRuntime` displaying values like "2175h" instead of correct hours/minutes. Root cause was a `* 60` conversion in AddLibraryModal sending seconds to backend expecting minutes; added `>= 20000` legacy seconds guard across shared formatting utilities.
- **NZBGet test connection and queue auth errors:** Fixed `CallXmlRpcAsync` not passing HTTP status code to `HttpRequestException`, removed duplicate catch block in `TestConnectionAsync`, and improved auth-specific error logging in `GetQueueAsync`.
- **NZBGet downloads falsely reported as failed:** Downloads containing unrecognized audio formats (e.g., `.wv` WavPack files) were marked as `ImportFailed` because `FileUtils.IsAudioFile()` did not recognize the extension, causing the completed download processor to find zero importable files.
- **Post-import scan scanning download directory instead of library:** After importing files, the scan job was enqueued with the download/destination path, causing `ScanBackgroundService` to scan the download directory and trigger spurious "Refusing to associate file outside audiobook folder" warnings. Fixed by passing `null` to the scan enqueue so the scanner uses the audiobook's `BasePath` or global `OutputPath`. Also added `BasePath` population in `CompletedDownloadProcessor` after directory imports so the audiobook's library path is always known.
- **Transmission magnet links not starting (e.g. AudioBookBay):** When both a magnet link and an HTTP torrent URL were available (common with Prowlarr indexers), the Transmission adapter sent only the bare magnet link via `filename`. Transmission's weaker DHT/tracker metadata resolution often stalled at "Downloading metadata..." while qBittorrent handled the same magnet fine. Fixed by pre-downloading the .torrent file from the HTTP `TorrentUrl` when a magnet link is the primary URL — sending full torrent data via `metainfo` gives Transmission complete tracker lists and piece hashes so it starts immediately. Also added explicit `"paused": false` to the `torrent-add` RPC call to guard against Transmission instances with `start-added-torrents` disabled. Additionally, fixed JSON serialization to use `UnsafeRelaxedJsonEscaping` preventing `&`/`+` in magnet links from being escaped to `\u00XX`, and added `Uri.UnescapeDataString` normalization for magnet links — Transmission's magnet parser does not URL-decode percent-encoded tracker URLs (e.g. `tr=http%3a%2f%2f...`), causing silent tracker resolution failure and permanent metadata stall.
- **Removed dead legacy download client code:** Removed ~750 lines of unused `SendToQBittorrent`, `SendToTransmission`, `GetTransmissionSessionId`, `SendToSABnzbd`, `SendToNZBGet`, and `EnsureIndexerApiKeyOnNzbUrlAsync` methods from `DownloadService.cs` and the unused `IDownloadClientService` interface from `IServices.cs`. All download traffic uses the adapter gateway (`_clientGateway.AddAsync`).


## [0.2.55] - 2026-03-01

### Added
- **Regression coverage for trust/proxy behavior:** Added API tests validating `*Arr standard` forwarded-header trust configuration and caller redaction behavior differences between public-network and private-network callers.

### Changed
- **`*arr standard` reverse-proxy trust model:** Updated forwarded-header handling to trust common private proxy networks (`10/8`, `172.16/12`, `192.168/16`, `fc00::/7`, `fe80::/10`) and process `X-Forwarded-Host` in addition to `X-Forwarded-For`/`X-Forwarded-Proto` for Docker/Synology/reverse-proxy deployments.
- **Secret redaction trust policy:** Adjusted secret redaction decisions to match `*Arr standard` behavior by treating local/private-network callers as trusted perimeter callers, while still requiring admin/API-key authentication for public-network callers.
- **Security/auth guidance text:** Updated API/Swagger guidance text to reflect trusted-network redaction behavior (`trusted-network/auth`) instead of localhost-only wording.

### Fixed
- **Indexer test + download client test in containerized LAN setups:** Removed over-restrictive private/loopback target blocking for these connectivity test flows, preventing false failures like successful test followed by save errors in common Synology Docker bridge-network deployments.
- **Download client modal test credential fallback:** When testing an existing download client from the edit modal, the request now includes the client `id` so backend test logic can reuse saved credentials (for example password/API key) when the input field is left blank.

## [0.2.54] - 2026-02-28

### Added
- **URL-segment API versioning (v1):** Added consistent URL-segment API versioning across controllers (`/api/v1/...`) with ApiExplorer/Swagger alignment and version substitution in generated docs.
- **Runtime API version support in startup config:** Added `ApiVersion`/`apiVersion` to startup configuration models and responses so the frontend can dynamically resolve API version without requiring a frontend rebuild.
- **Centralized frontend API base/version helper:** Added `fe/src/services/apiBase.ts` to unify API base URL/path construction, dynamic version application, and reusable helpers (`buildApiPath`, image URL detection).
- **Swagger auth guidance improvements:** Added global OpenAPI operation filtering/documentation to show auth requirements and provide clearer instructions for obtaining/using available authorization methods in Swagger UI.
- **Persistent server session storage:** Added database-backed `UserSessions` persistence (migration: `20260301033814_AddPersistentUserSessions`) so authenticated sessions can survive API process restarts.

### Changed
- **Endpoint namespace cleanup:** Moved ISBN-to-ASIN lookup from Amazon namespace to metadata namespace (`/api/v1/metadata/asin-from-isbn/{isbn}`) to reflect actual ownership/responsibility.
- **Frontend endpoint usage normalization:** Replaced hardcoded `/api/v1/...` strings throughout the frontend with shared dynamic API path builders so endpoint versioning is controlled centrally.
- **Startup config API version normalization:** Normalized equivalent version forms (e.g., `1.0`, `1.0.0`) to `1` to prevent unnecessary runtime URL churn.
- **Middleware/route compatibility behavior:** Updated auth/antiforgery and routing-related checks to properly recognize versioned API paths while preserving expected enforcement behavior.
- **SignalR hub URL resolution (frontend):** Reworked SignalR hub URL construction to derive from runtime/API configuration instead of relying on hardcoded dev host assumptions, improving compatibility with proxied/local environments.
- **SignalR reconnect policy:** Updated reconnect behavior to use capped exponential backoff with jitter and continue retrying after disconnects instead of stopping after a fixed attempt cap.
- **Remember-me client token persistence:** Updated frontend session token storage behavior so `Remember me` uses persistent storage, while non-remembered logins remain session-scoped.

### Fixed
- **Authenticated image loading regressions:** Fixed dev/proxied image-loading behavior so backend image URLs remain same-origin in development and avoid ORB/cross-origin request issues.
- **Wanted view poster loading on initial render:** Fixed initial poster image rendering in Wanted view (images previously appearing only after scroll due to memoized row rendering + async protected image updates).
- **Protected image auth-state race:** Fixed startup race where unknown auth state could briefly issue direct image requests and fall back to placeholders before protected image fetch logic engaged.
- **Add New metadata ingestion stability:** Hardened metadata response handling for audiobook add flows so missing/invalid payloads no longer crash add actions.
- **Add New duplicate search/image request loop:** Reduced repeated API calls from Add New result rendering by preventing submit+debounce overlap, guarding in-flight/attempted cover selection work, and avoiding repeated immediate retries after backend image failures.
- **Concurrent protected image request duplication:** Added in-flight deduplication for authenticated image blob fetches so concurrent requests for the same image URL collapse to one network request.
- **Dev websocket proxying for hubs:** Added Vite `/hubs` websocket proxy support so SignalR hub connections work consistently through the frontend dev server.
- **`POST /api/v1/library/preview-path` ISBN contract mismatch:** Normalized frontend metadata payloads so `metadata.isbn` is sent as an array (or omitted), matching backend model binding expectations and preventing preview-path validation failures.
- **Vue Router guard deprecation warning:** Migrated router guard from legacy `next(...)` callback usage to return-style navigation values to remove deprecation warnings.
- **`BulkEditModal` component resolution warning:** Fixed unresolved `<ModalHeader>` warning by importing/registering `ModalHeader` in the bulk edit modal component.
- **Remember-me durability:** Fixed remember-me behavior so long-lived sessions now survive both browser restarts and API restarts, instead of being dropped by session-only client storage and in-memory server cache.

### Removed
- **Obsolete Audible/Amazon controllers and endpoints:** Removed legacy Audible auth/library/controller surfaces that were no longer used in canary app flow.
- **Legacy Amazon search/scrape services:** Removed obsolete Amazon-specific search/scrape plumbing (including unused service paths tied to deprecated search behavior).
- **Legacy endpoint compatibility paths:** Removed unneeded legacy endpoint aliases now that frontend and backend are shipped together in canary and no third-party compatibility layer is required.
- **Unused US-domain retry path:** Removed deprecated US-domain retry logic and associated test coverage no longer used by current metadata/search flow.

## [0.2.53] - 2026-02-27

### Fixed
- **Security banner state when auth is enabled:** Fixed a frontend state bug where unauthenticated `401` responses from `GET /api/configuration/startupconfig` were interpreted as `auth disabled`, causing the no-auth security banner to remain visible even when authentication was enabled.
- **`GET /api/library` wanted-flag path evaluation:** Hardened wanted-flag file checks to safely handle invalid/problematic file paths without throwing, preventing endpoint-level `500` responses in production data edge cases.
- **`GET /api/library` legacy ISBN materialization crash:** Fixed a production-only crash path where legacy non-array/invalid JSON values in `Audiobooks.Isbn` could fail EF materialization (`Invalid token type`) and return `500`.

### Changed
- **Audiobook EF mapping resiliency:** Updated `Audiobook.Isbn` persistence mapping to use the resilient JSON value converter/comparer pattern already used by other JSON-backed list fields (`Authors`, `Genres`, `Tags`, `Narrators`, `AuthorAsins`).

### Added
- **Regression coverage for library resilience:** Added API integration coverage that simulates legacy ISBN text data and verifies `GET /api/library` remains successful.

## [0.2.52] - 2026-02-26

### Changed
- **Authentication-disabled UX & deployment guidance:** Listenarr now emits a clear startup warning in the backend logs and shows a persistent in-app banner when authentication is disabled, reinforcing that no-auth mode is intended for trusted LAN/VPN use and not direct internet exposure.
- **Secret handling in API responses:** Centralized API response redaction for sensitive configuration/indexer payloads (startup config, application settings, API configs, download clients, and indexers) so remote unauthenticated callers receive masked values instead of raw secrets.
- **Audiobook identifier model:** Introduced a canonical typed external identifier system for audiobooks (`ASIN`, `ISBN`, `OLID`) with legacy field compatibility (dual-read/dual-write behavior for existing `Asin`, `Isbn`, and `OpenLibraryId` fields during migration).
- **Image loading pipeline (frontend):** Unified AudiobooksView image loading onto the protected image/blob pipeline so authenticated deployments no longer rely on direct `<img src="/api/images/...">` requests that cannot send auth headers.
- **Audiobook detail & library view architecture:** Streamlined AudiobooksView/AudiobookDetailView behavior with safer shared image handling, consolidated selection logic, memoized status calculation, improved tab/hash/query sync, canonical detail-endpoint loading, and shared desktop/mobile action configuration.
- **Metadata refresh behavior:** Metadata refresh is now an explicit identifier-driven “rescan metadata” workflow that performs patch-style updates (non-empty provider values overwrite existing values, blanks do not erase data).
- **Description normalization:** Metadata descriptions are stripped/normalized from HTML while preserving readable text content for display and storage.
- **Edit audiobook UX:** The Edit Audiobook modal now opens in the large size layout to better accommodate metadata and identifier editing.

### Fixed
- **Reported security issues:** Verified/fixed the previously reported issues where anonymous callers could retrieve startup API key material and create arbitrary admin users via `POST /api/account/register` (`isAdmin=true` abuse path).
- **Startup config secret exposure:** Startup config responses now redact secrets (including SSL certificate password) for remote unauthenticated callers, and startup config save responses no longer echo raw secrets to untrusted callers.
- **Identifier provenance spoofing:** `PUT /api/library/{id}/identifiers` now forces user-submitted identifiers to `Manual` source unless the row is an unchanged existing server-owned identifier (`Imported`/`Provider`), preventing provenance spoofing.
- **Duplicate identifiers in UI:** Fixed duplicate identifier rows in the edit modal caused by legacy imported identifiers overlapping with canonical manual/provider identifiers (same normalized value now deduped in effective responses and cleanup-on-save flow).
- **Metadata rescan leakage:** `rescan-metadata` failure responses now return a generic error body to callers instead of exposing attempted ASIN/ISBN lists (attempted IDs are retained only in debug logs).
- **Metadata rescan abuse controls:** Added cooldown/rate limiting per audiobook + actor (IP/user) and caps on provider attempts per rescan to reduce abuse potential in no-auth deployments.
- **Logging leaks:** Removed raw header dumps from session-auth logging, and replaced token/API key prefix logging with hashed fingerprints in auth middleware and logout logging.
- **SSRF hardening gaps (outbound tests/webhooks):** Added DNS/private-IP/final-URI validation across notification sends and high-risk indexer outbound test/import paths; public callers can no longer use these routes to target localhost/private-network hosts.
- **Debug/process endpoint exposure:** Restricted debug/diagnostic/process-control endpoints (library debug, FFmpeg, Discord bot control/diagnostics, diagnostics notification test, Prowlarr debug routes) to localhost/private-network callers or authenticated admin/API-key users.
- **Image cache SSRF protections:** Hardened image downloading with DNS/private-IP checks and redirect validation to reduce SSRF risk in image caching/fetch flows.
- **Audiobook cover recovery on cache miss:** Fixed `/api/images/{identifier}` fallback cases that returned empty/placeholder responses when cache files were missing but metadata providers could still supply a valid image.
- **Audimeta fallback bug:** Fixed a fallback chain bug where Audimeta `Description` values were incorrectly treated as image URLs, blocking Audnexus/OpenLibrary image fallback.
- **ASIN/author/ISBN fallback routing:** Tightened ISBN detection so author names/ASIN-like values are no longer misrouted into OpenLibrary ISBN lookups.
- **Cache alias reuse for changed primary ASINs:** When a primary ASIN changes, `/api/images/{newAsin}` can now reuse a cached image stored under an alternate identifier instead of falling back to placeholder.
- **Author image behavior:** Author cards no longer fall back to audiobook cover art; they now correctly show the placeholder when no author-specific image exists.
- **Auth-required image loading in AudiobooksView:** Fixed 401 image failures caused by direct `<img>` requests in authenticated mode; images now load via authenticated fetch + blob URLs.
- **Missing cover recovery (provider fallback):** When no local image exists and no cached file is present, Listenarr now properly reaches out to providers (Audimeta/Audnexus/OpenLibrary), caches the image, and returns it instead of a zero-size/placeholder response when recoverable.
- **Genres after metadata refresh:** Fixed audiobook detail responses so refreshed metadata fields (including genres and other rescanned fields) are returned by the detail endpoint and visible after metadata rescan.
- **Runtime formatting in AudiobookDetailView:** Fixed audiobook runtime display to treat stored runtime values as minutes (e.g., `1472` now renders as `24h 32m` instead of `0h 24m`).
- **AudiobookDetail/AudiobooksView navigation mismatch:** Fixed status-click navigation and tab resolution issues between AudiobooksView and AudiobookDetailView (`downloads` mismatch vs supported detail tabs).
- **Frontend test stability and warnings:** Fixed failing frontend tests (`AddNewView.spec.ts`, `AudiobooksView`, `AudiobookDetailView`, related suites) and cleaned up Vue test warnings introduced during refactors.
- **API test determinism:** Stabilized test auth defaults in the API test factory so endpoint tests don’t inherit local auth-enabled config unexpectedly.

### Added
- **Typed audiobook external identifiers:** Added `AudiobookExternalIdentifier` entity/model/table and migration-backed persistence for multiple identifiers per audiobook (ASIN/ISBN/OLID) with normalization, primary marker support, source tracking (`manual/provider/imported`), and optional region support for ASINs.
- **Identifier migration & backfill:** Added an EF Core migration to create the external identifiers table and backfill legacy ASIN/ISBN/OpenLibrary values into the new structure at startup migration time.
- **Identifier management API:** Added `GET /api/library/{id}/identifiers` and `PUT /api/library/{id}/identifiers` to view/edit associated identifiers with validation, dedupe, and legacy-field synchronization.
- **Identifier editing UI:** Added identifier editing in the Edit Audiobook modal (add/remove ASIN/ISBN/OLID, mark primary identifier, show source badges) and a full associated identifier list with primary indicator on the audiobook detail page.
- **Metadata rescan endpoint and UI action:** Added `POST /api/library/{id}/rescan-metadata` plus a new “Rescan Metadata” action in AudiobookDetailView so users can repair metadata after adding/correcting identifiers.
- **Metadata rescan image repair:** Metadata rescans now also attempt to cache/update the audiobook image when providers return a cover image URL.
- **Cover recovery fallback expansion:** Added additional image fallback paths for cache-miss covers using local library identifiers (ISBN/OLID), alternate stored identifiers, and OpenLibrary title+author ISBN discovery when provider ASIN lookups fail.
- **Security utility infrastructure:** Added shared security helpers for request trust evaluation, secret hashing, endpoint access gating, outbound request validation (URL/DNS/redirect/final URI checks), and reusable API response redaction.
- **Regression coverage:** Added/updated tests covering image fallback chains, identifier deduplication/provenance handling, metadata rescan behavior/rate limits, and security redaction/hardening paths.

### Removed
- **Verbose sensitive logging:** Removed raw request-header dumps from session authentication logging on missing-token startupconfig requests.
- **Public error detail leakage:** Removed detailed attempted identifier lists and attempt metadata from public `rescan-metadata` failure payloads (kept only in debug logs).
- **Author image fallback to book covers:** Removed audiobook-cover fallback behavior for author cards so missing author images consistently use the placeholder image.
- **Legacy duplicate identifier presentation:** Removed duplicate imported/manual identifier rows from effective identifier responses when a canonical identifier already exists for the same normalized value.
- **api/account/register:** Removed because the app currently creates/updates admin credentials through SaveApplicationSettingsAsync() via Settings, but a user could start with "AuthenticationRequired": "true" in the config.json and no users exist and be locked out, but this is not a valid usecase.

## [0.2.51] - 2026-02-23

### Fixed
- **UI (Remote Path Mapping):** Fixed Remote Path Mapping modal Save action by ensuring the shared `ModalForm` includes `id="modal-form"` so footer Save buttons using `form="modal-form"` correctly submit the form.


## [0.2.50] - 2026-02-22

### Changed
- **Persistence & EF Core:** Pinned EF Core to 9.0.0 in central package management and refactored persistence registration to avoid resolving scoped EF option-configurators from the root provider. Registered a singleton `DbContextOptions<ListenArrDbContext>` and an `IDbContextFactory<ListenArrDbContext>` (Simple factory) so contexts are created safely at scoped time.
- **Startup migrations:** Startup now applies EF migrations via the `IDbContextFactory` (migration errors are logged and do not prevent startup in development). Added a development-friendly fallback for safe startup when migrations cannot be applied.
- **Migrations:** Added an AutoSync migration `20260222154541_SyncModelToCurrent` (no-op `Up` with a preserved `.Designer.cs` model snapshot) to keep tooling/model metadata in sync; `dotnet ef database update` reported the database as already up to date.
- **Design-time tooling:** Added `ListenArrDesignTimeDbContextFactory` to improve EF tooling support.
- **Bugfix (DI):** Fixed runtime failures caused by resolving scoped EF configurators from the root provider (controllers and startup no longer throw when activating DbContexts).
- **Frontend polish:** `fe/src/App.vue` — brand/logo now links to `/`, hover background bleed fixed, headphone animation triggers on brand hover, and a mobile sidebar backdrop was added. `fe/src/views/settings/IndexersTab.vue` — Prowlarr modal inputs updated to use shared `.form-input` styles for consistent visuals.
- **Build/dev:** Verified solution build succeeded locally and frontend dev server (Vite) ran for visual validation of the UI changes.
 - **Notifications UI:** Redesigned the Notifications modal to accept service-specific credentials (Telegram Bot Token + Chat ID, Pushover API Token + User Key, Pushbullet Access Token), hide the generic webhook URL for token-only services, and ensure trigger badges render in a consistent order.

### Added
- **Notifications / NTFY:** Implemented NTFY publish compatibility (plain text POST body plus `Title`, `Tags`, and `Priority` headers) and added a diagnostics endpoint `POST /api/diagnostics/test-notification` to send test notifications. Frontend Test buttons now call the diagnostics endpoint for live testing.

### Fixed
- **Notifications UI & Webhooks:** Fixed the notification card Test button so it triggers a real test call; added webhook trigger selection in the Notifications settings and aligned `CheckboxCard` layout for consistent visuals.
 - **Notifications implementations:** Standardized and fixed all notification integrations and payloads (NTFY, Telegram, Pushover, Pushbullet, Slack, and generic/Zapier). Highlights:
   - NTFY: sends plain-text body with `Title`, `Priority`, and `Tags` headers.
   - Telegram: sends JSON to `sendMessage` with `chat_id`, `text`, `disable_notification`, and `parse_mode`.
   - Pushover: posts `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` to `/1/messages.json` with `token`, `user`, `message`, and `title`.
   - Pushbullet: posts JSON to `/v2/pushes` using `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>` and `type=note` payloads.
   - Slack: posts `{"text":"..."}` to Incoming Webhooks URLs.
   - Zapier/Generic: posts the full rich JSON payload produced by the payload builder to the exact configured webhook URL.
   Temporary redacted request/response logging was added to aid diagnostics during verification.

### Security
- **DevDependency removal:** Removed `source-map-explorer` from devDependencies to address a transitive `ejs` vulnerability and updated lockfile(s).

## [0.2.49] - 2026-02-21

### Fixed
- **Settings save CSRF failure**: ensured antiforgery token is refreshed and bound to authenticated user. Added `tokenReadyPromise` in `ApiService` and blocked unsafe requests until token is available. Removed manual CSRFFetch from `saveApplicationSettings`.
- **Startup config persistence**: previously, `AuthenticationRequired` was preserved from `config.json` and ignored when the frontend saved.  Toggle in General Settings now updates the flag and writes it to the file; authentication behaves the same as the other startup options.
- **Token export**: properly export `ensureImageCached` and cleaned stray code from `api.ts` that caused build errors.
- **Startup cache logging**: added missing `logger` import and removed unsafe `console` usage.

### Changed
- **Logging cleanup**: converted remaining `console.log` calls in `ApiService` to `logger.debug` and tidied comments.


## [0.2.48] - 2026-01-14

### Added
- **Prowlarr compatibility improvements**: `POST /api/v1/indexers`, `POST /api/v1/indexer` and `PUT /api/v1/indexer/{id}` now accept varied payload shapes (nested `settings`, `fields` arrays and multiple property name variants) and return standard DTOs with non-null `fields` and `tags` for better interoperability.
- **Toast suppression**: Global message-level and per-indexer toast suppression to reduce notification noise during rapid indexer imports (default suppression window: 5 seconds).
- **Settings — loading UI**: Added visible loading indicators and a `LoadingState` placeholder to Settings tab components (`QualityProfilesTab`, `NotificationsTab`, `RootFoldersSettings`, `IndexersTab`, `DownloadClientsTab`). Inline header spinners and unit tests were added to improve perceived responsiveness during async loads.


### Changed
- **`ProwlarrCompatController` behavior**:
  - `PUT /api/v1/indexer/{id}` implements upsert semantics (creates when missing) and **deduplicates** by normalized URL + API key. Deduplication runs client-side (pulls results with `AsNoTracking().ToList()` then normalizes) to avoid EF translation issues.
  - Removed early create-time broadcast in `PUT` and compute `created` after dedupe so `IndexersUpdated` is broadcast once (prevents duplicate broadcasts/toasts).
  - `DELETE /api/v1/indexer/{id}` tolerates `id == 0` from external clients and returns an empty JSON object with a warning log to avoid noisy caller errors.
- **General Settings — API Key control**: Improved the API key input in the General Settings tab—input is full width with an inline visibility toggle and the regenerate/copy buttons placed inside the input (order: visibility, regenerate, copy). The regenerate button uses a red hue to indicate the key will be invalidated, and the copy button uses a blue hue. Functionality is unchanged and unit tests pass locally.
- **PasswordInput component**: Added a named `append` slot to `PasswordInput.vue` so callers can inject inline controls (e.g., copy/regenerate buttons) without relying on deep CSS overrides. `ApiKeyControl` now uses the slot, improving layout robustness and accessibility. Unit tests updated and pass locally.
- **Frontend — route prefetch**: Added route prefetch in `main.ts` to improve perceived navigation performance.
- **Images / Author ASIN**: Prefer stored author ASIN for author image lookup and probe the DB when a cached image lookup returns NotFound; this reduces unnecessary Audnexus calls and improves cache hit rates.
- **qBittorrent adapter**: Prefer `IHttpClientFactory` with a cookie-client fallback, use injected `HttpClient` for auth requests, and clarified auth failure messages; added `QBittorrentHelpers` and robustness improvements in the adapter.
- **Dependencies**: Bumped frontend/backend dependencies and regenerated lockfiles.

### Fixed
- **qBittorrent Test**: `qBittorrent` client test now attempts authentication when the unauthenticated `/api/v2/app/version` values.
- **Duplicate notifications & race**: Added `NotificationSuppressionSeconds`, `_lastToastTimes`, `_lastToastMessages`, and helper methods `ShouldSendToastForIndexer`/`ShouldSendToastForMessage`. Fixed an edge-case race where the per-indexer check previously updated the global message timestamp causing unintended self-suppression.
- **EF translation error**: Moved normalization/dedupe to in-memory evaluation to avoid EF Core InvalidOperationException when calling `NormalizeIndexerUrl` inside an EF expression.
- **Download client test behavior**: The Test button on the **Download Client** modal uses the current (unsaved) form input values; the Test button on the download client card in the Settings tab tests the saved DB configuration values.
- **Images / Author ASIN tests**: Mocked `IAudiobookRepository.GetAuthorAsinByNameAsync` in ImagesController tests so the stored‑ASIN path is exercised; tests updated accordingly.
- **Frontend — Loading UI & tests**: Added VTU test stubs for `LoadingState` and `PhSpinner` and unit tests covering loading indicators in settings tabs to prevent component-resolution warnings in tests.
- **Tests**: Added and updated unit tests in `tests/Listenarr.Api.Tests` (e.g., `ProwlarrCompatControllerTests`, `ProwlarrEndpointsTests`) to validate broadcasting, idempotent PUT upsert, delete `id==0` tolerance, and toast/message-level dedupe. All API tests pass locally (253 tests).

### Removed
- Removed duplicate/early Broadcast/toast on the create path in the `PUT` flow to avoid double notifications.


## [0.2.47] - 2026-01-13

### Added
- **Prowlarr → Notifications**: When indexers are imported via the Prowlarr-compatible API, the server now broadcasts `IndexersUpdated` and also publishes a toast and persistent `Notification` so the activity bell dropdown shows the import (includes created indexer names).
- **Settings hub auto-connect**: The frontend now automatically establishes a dedicated Settings hub connection (when the downloads hub's downloads connection is established) so the SPA reliably receives settings and indexer broadcasts.
- **Debugging**: Added debug endpoints `GET /api/v1/debug/settings/clients` and `POST /api/v1/debug/indexers/publish` to help verify hub connectivity.

### Fixed
- **SignalR**: Fixed missing SettingsHub client connections and ensured notifications are published when indexers are created.
- **Add New / Search runtime formatting**: Fixed a miscalculation where search result runtimes (provided in seconds) were being treated as minutes in the Add New and Search views. Runtimes are now converted from seconds to minutes and formatted correctly (e.g., "10h 20m"); added a unit test verifying the formatted display.
- **SettingsView / GeneralSettingsTab reactivity**: Fixed a recursive update/prop sync issue in `GeneralSettingsTab` by adding a syncing guard and a focused watcher for `useUsProxy` so in-place parent updates propagate reliably without creating a watch loop. This resolves the failing SettingsView unit tests.
- **Tests**: Updated/added frontend unit tests to cover the runtime formatting and reactivity fixes; all frontend unit tests pass locally.

- **Error Recovery**: If server synchronization fails during client configuration updates, local changes are automatically reverted to maintain data consistency

### Changed

- **SettingsView.vue**: Enhanced `saveMapping` function to handle automatic client assignment with immediate local state updates and server error recovery

### Added

- **Remote Path Mapping Assignment**: Download clients can now be assigned one or more remote path mappings directly through a dropdown selector in the client configuration modal
- **Dynamic Remote Path Mapping Loading**: Remote path mappings are loaded dynamically when editing download clients for better data initialization
- **Visual Remote Path Mapping Display**: Settings view now shows which remote path mappings are assigned to each download client
- **Confirmation Modals for Deletions**: Added confirmation modals for deleting APIs, remote path mappings, and metadata sources to prevent accidental deletions
- **Enhanced Type Safety**: Introduced `DownloadClientSettings` type and extended `DownloadClientConfiguration` for better typed access to client settings including `remotePathMappingIds`

### Changed

- **API Endpoint Consistency**: Updated all remote path mapping API calls in `api.ts` to use pluralized `/remotepathmappings` endpoints for consistency with backend routes
- **Download Client Form Modal**: Replaced `RemotePathMappingsManager` component with a streamlined dropdown selector for assigning remote path mappings
- **Settings View Layout**: Improved organization of remote path mapping display and deletion flows with confirmation modals

## [0.2.38] - 2025-11-20

### Added

- MyAnonamouse search improvements: added targeted audiobook searches (sets `main_cat=13`) and refined request payloads to match the indexer's `loadSearchJSONbasic.php` form shape for more reliable results.

### Changed

- SearchService: switched MyAnonamouse requests to use the site-expected form-encoded payload, include `tor[text]`, `tor[main_cat][]`, `tor[searchIn]=torrents`, and scoped `tor[srchIn][...]` flags to prefer title/author where available.
- Improved response parsing for MyAnonamouse: robust detection and prioritization of magnet links and .torrent URLs (including constructing magnet links from known hashes), and conservative NZB handling when explicit NZB fields are present.
- Query sanitization: sanitize indexer queries to remove problematic characters (curly apostrophes and parentheses) that impacted matching on MyAnonamouse.
- Logging: outbound MyAnonamouse payloads are logged at Information level to aid debugging and verification.

### Fixed

- Reduced false-positive ebook results from MyAnonamouse searches by targeting audiobooks and tightening search fields.
- Hardened parsing to populate `SearchResult` fields (Title, Torrent/Magnet/NZB URLs, Size, Seeders) for a wider range of MyAnonamouse response shapes.


## [0.2.37] - 2025-11-19

### Added

- Search Settings: new section in General Settings with toggles to enable/disable provider searches and controls to tune search behavior:
  - `enableAmazonSearch`, `enableAudibleSearch`, `enableOpenLibrarySearch` (all enabled by default)
  - `searchCandidateCap` (default: 100) — limit of unified ASIN candidates prior to metadata enrichment
  - `searchResultCap` (default: 100) — overall result cap returned to the UI
  - `searchFuzzyThreshold` (default: 0.20) — fuzzy-matching threshold used by the intelligent search

### Changed

- Backend: `ApplicationSettings` extended with search configuration fields and an EF Core migration added so these values are persisted in the database.
- Search pipeline: `SearchService` now reads application-level search settings and applies provider skip flags, candidate limits and fuzzy threshold. Unified candidate lists are trimmed prior to metadata enrichment and the combined result set is capped after merging indexer results.
- Frontend: `SettingsView` and types updated to expose the new controls. Normalization logic now prefers camelCase and preserves a single canonical payload shape when saving.

### Fixed

- Fixed settings persistence and save behavior: removed duplicated/Conflicting PascalCase keys in the frontend payload and corrected Pinia ref handling so settings save/load remain reactive and consistent.
- Fixed an issue where previously-applied migrations left existing databases with zero/default values for the new search fields; migrations and DB updates were added to ensure sensible defaults are present for existing installs.
- Tests: updated intelligent-search integration tests to reflect the new search settings and behavior.


## [0.2.36] - 2025-11-17

### Added

- Debug endpoint for indexer troubleshooting: `GET /api/indexers/{id}/debug-search` returns raw remote payload and parsed results for developer inspection.

### Changed

- MyAnonamouse indexer: switched authentication to use the `mam_id` cookie (from indexer settings) and hardened request handling to tolerate multiple JSON/HTML-wrapped response shapes.
- Search result canonical links: added `ResultUrl` to `SearchResult` and populated it for MyAnonamouse (canonical `https://myanonamouse.net/t/{id}`), Internet Archive (`https://archive.org/details/{identifier}`), and Torznab/Newznab (use `<link>` when present). Frontend now prefers `result.resultUrl` for title links.
- Frontend: updated `ManualSearchModal.vue`, `SearchView.vue` and related components to make result titles link to the indexer item page (fallbacks: `productUrl`, `torrentUrl`, `nzbUrl`, `magnetLink`) and added `resultUrl` to TypeScript types.

### Fixed

- Robust parsing fixes for multiple indexer response shapes and case-insensitive deserialization in debug flows; ensures `SearchResult` fields (Title, Size, Seeders, TorrentUrl, Source) are populated for MyAnonamouse results.
- Backend: ensured `SearchResult.Source` is consistently set (fallbacks: indexer name, implementation, host) so UI displays indexer names reliably.

## [0.2.35] - 2025-11-16

### Added

- Authoritative EF Core migration to add missing `ApplicationSettings` columns (e.g. `EnabledNotificationTriggers`, `WebhookUrl`, US proxy fields, and related settings). This ensures fresh installs and upgrades receive the required schema changes via migrations.

### Changed

- Removed the emergency runtime ALTER/PRAGMA schema patch from `Program.cs`; schema changes are now managed exclusively through EF Core migrations.
- Consolidated and cleaned up iterative/no-op migration artifacts introduced during debugging; created a single authoritative migration and backed up removed migration files for safety.

### Fixed

- **State Persistence**: Ensured search queries and UI preferences are properly saved and restored across sessions

## [0.2.31] - 2025-11-10

### Added

- Server-side API key passthrough: the `DiscordBotService` now injects a `LISTENARR_API_KEY` environment variable into the helper process when a startup-config API key exists. This allows trusted helper processes to authenticate programmatic requests to the backend without an interactive login.

### Changed

- Admin command changes:
  - Temporarily disabled the admin `request-config set-channel` subcommand to avoid accidental channel configuration changes while debugging production helper behavior. The change was applied in both the server command payload (`DiscordController`) and the helper `tools/discord-bot/index.js` (including published/bin copies) so the subcommand will not be registered until explicitly re-enabled.

- Bot helper auth and networking:
  - The Node helper (`tools/discord-bot/index.js`) now reads `process.env.LISTENARR_API_KEY` when present and automatically attaches `X-Api-Key: <key>` to outgoing fetch requests (unless a request explicitly provides its own ApiKey header).
  - SignalR connections from the helper use the API key as the access token (via `accessTokenFactory`) so the `/hubs/*/negotiate` step accepts the helper in authenticated deployments.
  - The same changes were applied to the published/bin copies of the helper (`listenarr.api/publish/...` and `listenarr.api/bin/Release/...`) so runtime images built from publish output include the fix.

- Frontend: Mobile & responsive UX improvements
  - `SettingsView` desktop tabs now use a horizontal carousel when tabs overflow to prevent layout overflow and enable keyboard/chevron navigation.
  - `App` header: mobile search replaced the pseudo-backdrop with a real DOM backdrop for reliable click-to-close behavior; mobile search input overlay behavior refined; mobile menu (hamburger) button hidden on desktop via responsive CSS.
  - `AudiobookDetailView`: mobile actions reorganized — primary actions are surfaced inside a collapsed "More" menu on small screens and the dropdown is positioned as an absolute overlay to avoid expanding the top-nav.
  - `AddNewView`: search and action controls improved for small screens (stacked, full-width CTAs, scrollbar-gutter stability) for better touch ergonomics.
  - `SystemView` / `LogsView`: fixed horizontal overflow and long-line wrapping on narrow viewports.
  - `CustomSelect` component: fixed click propagation race and replaced an unsafe `$event.target` access with a typed native input handler to resolve TypeScript build issues.
  - Misc CSS tweaks: added `scrollbar-gutter`, ensured `min-width: 0` on flex children, and other responsive fixes to eliminate unintended horizontal scrolling across multiple views.

### Fixed

- Resolved 401s observed in production where the helper used the correct `LISTENARR_URL` but did not present credentials when calling `/api/configuration/settings` or negotiating SignalR. Passing the API key into the helper and including it on requests resolves those authentication failures for programmatic helper flows.

- Frontend fixes:
  - Resolved a TypeScript build error caused by unsafe event target access in `CustomSelect.vue` by introducing a typed native input handler.
  - Fixed mobile top-nav layout shift when opening the "More" actions menu by making the dropdown an absolute overlay.
  - Prevented settings tabs from overflowing the header by adding an overflow-hidden carousel wrapper and navigation chevrons on desktop when needed.

## [0.2.30] - 2025-11-09

### Fixed

- Discord helper bot startup race: the Node helper resolved `LISTENARR_URL` asynchronously at module load time which allowed the initial network calls to default to `http://localhost:5000`, causing authentication failures (SignalR negotiation and settings fetch returned 401) in containerized production. The startup routine now awaits `resolveListenarrUrl()` before performing any outbound requests so the environment-provided `LISTENARR_URL` (or `.env`) is used immediately.

## [0.2.29] - 2025-11-09

### Changed

- Key changes for 0.2.29 (URL resolution & Docker-aware fallbacks)
  - Added `IHttpContextAccessor` usage/injection to support constructing the Listenarr public URL from the current HTTP request when available (useful behind reverse proxies)
  - Improved URL resolution priority (used when the app needs to provide an absolute Listenarr URL to helper processes or external systems):
    1. `LISTENARR_PUBLIC_URL` environment variable (highest priority)
    2. Current HTTP request (uses `IHttpContextAccessor` and honors X-Forwarded-* headers)
    3. Startup config (configured via the existing startup JSON/config service)
    4. Fallback: `host.docker.internal` (when running in Docker) or `localhost` (non-Docker fallback)
  - Docker-aware fallback: when `DOCKER_ENV` environment variable is present/true the runtime will prefer `host.docker.internal` instead of `localhost` for local host fallbacks
  - Additional per-step logging added to help diagnose URL resolution issues (logs which source was selected and any header-based values used)
  - Updated Dockerfile to explicitly set the `DOCKER_ENV` environment variable so Docker-aware fallbacks are enabled.

### Notes

- These changes make URL resolution more robust behind reverse proxies and in Docker-based deployments, and provide better logging to debug any cases where the helper bot (or external integrations) cannot reach the Listenarr API.

## [0.2.28] - 2025-11-09

### Changed

 - Publish and deployment reliability improvements
  - Ensure `tools/**` is included in publish output and runtime images by updating `listenarr.api/Listenarr.Api.csproj` and adding an explicit MSBuild `CopyToolsToPublish` target as a fallback.
  - The runtime Dockerfile (`listenarr.api/Dockerfile.runtime`) now accepts a build-arg `PUBLISH_DIR` and copies from that path; CI workflows were updated to pass the appropriate publish directory so images are built from the exact CI publish output (for example `listenarr.api/publish/linux-x64`).
  - CI and Canary workflows: added publish sanity checks, artifact upload (for debug), a fail-fast check in CI, and a copy-then-verify safety step in Canary so builds abort or repair when `tools` is missing from publish output.

### Fixed

 - Verified that local `dotnet publish` now includes `listenarr.api/publish/tools/discord-bot` and adjusted workflows and Docker build logic to make image builds deterministic and reproducible locally and in CI.
## [0.2.27] - 2025-11-09

### Fixed

  - **CI: fail-fast & publish verification**: Added quick-fail checks and publish-folder verification to CI and Canary workflows so builds abort if the `tools` folder is missing from publish output
    - Canary workflow now lists the publish folder, uploads the publish artifact for inspection, and contains a copy-then-verify step that will copy `tools` into the publish folder if CIS publish missed them
    - Main CI workflow now performs a fail-fast check after `dotnet publish` to avoid building/pushing images that don't include the discord helper files
    - These steps reduce the risk of releasing runtime images that cannot start the Discord helper bot

## [0.2.26] - 2025-11-09

### Fixed

 - **Publish: include tools folder**: Ensured `tools/**` is copied to the publish output by updating `Listenarr.Api.csproj` (added <CopyToPublishDirectory>PreserveNewest</CopyToPublishDirectory> for `tools\**\*.*`)
   - Fixes missing `/app/tools/discord-bot` inside runtime containers when publishing + copying publish output into images
   - After this change, run `dotnet publish` and rebuild your image so the tooling directory is included in the container

  - Ensures Node.js runtime is available for Discord bot process execution

## [0.2.24] - 2025-11-08

### Fixed

- **Database migration: Discord settings**: recreated migration with new timestamp `20251109043000_AddDiscordSettingsToApplicationSettings` to ensure it runs on all databases, including those with broken migration history
  - Migration adds `DiscordApplicationId`, `DiscordBotAvatar`, `DiscordBotEnabled`, `DiscordBotToken`, `DiscordBotUsername`, `DiscordChannelId`, `DiscordCommandGroupName`, `DiscordCommandSubcommandName`, and `DiscordGuildId`
  - **Automatic fix for existing users**: Renamed migration ensures it executes regardless of previous broken migration state, fixing databases without manual intervention

  - README documentation for bot setup and troubleshooting

### Fixed

- **Development-Only UI Elements**: Hidden test notification buttons in production
  - AudiobookDetailView: Wrapped 3 test notification buttons in `v-if="isDevelopment"` check
  - Buttons only visible in development mode, preventing confusion in production deployments
- **Discord bot session & CSRF flows**: improved reliability when users interact with the ephemeral select/confirm flow
  - Preserve interaction tokens so ephemeral replies can be removed when a request completes
  - Fetch antiforgery token from `/api/antiforgery/token` and retry POST /api/library/add with `X-XSRF-TOKEN` when the server returns CSRF errors
  - Implement cookie-aware fetch where possible (optional `fetch-cookie` + `tough-cookie` packages)
- **Metadata validation**: normalize metadata shapes before POSTing to `/api/library/add` so authors, narrators, tags and genres are always string arrays and series fields are stringified
- **Idempotency**: add `Idempotency-Key` header to library add requests to enable safe retries and deduplication
- **Message lifecycle & UX**: make the interactive flow ephemeral-only to avoid duplicate channel posts and update the original message instead of replying
  - On success the confirm button is updated to a disabled green “Added” button
  - Components are disabled immediately after Request to prevent double-processing

### Changed
